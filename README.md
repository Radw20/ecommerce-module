# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## 🙋‍♀️ About This Project

This project was created as part of a practical workshop to build an advanced but minimal e-commerce platform for online courses. The focus was on functionality and clean UI without overcomplicating the design.

Everything was built manually using basic tools and concepts in React, with simple localStorage management and SCSS for styling.

## 📌 Note

This is a hands-on, student-level project built with learning in mind – not meant to be perfect, but to show how real projects can be structured step by step.
